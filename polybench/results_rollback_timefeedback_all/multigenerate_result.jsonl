This is evident from the introduction of new variables (`t1`, `t2`, `t3`) that define the tile boundaries. This transformation helps in reducing cache misses by ensuring that the data accessed within a tile fits into the cache.\n\n2. **Loop Fusion/Fission**: The original loops are split into multiple loops (fission) and then fused back together in a way that reduces the number of iterations and improves locality. For example, the multiplication of `C[i][j]` by `beta` and the addition of `alpha * A[i][k] * B[k][j]` to `C[i][j]` are handled in separate loops but within the same tile.\n\n3. **Parallelization**: The use of `#pragma omp parallel for` indicates that the loops are parallelized to take advantage of multi-core processors. This is a common optimization for loops that can be executed independently.\n\n4. **Loop Interchange**: The order of loops is changed to improve cache locality. For example, the innermost loop over `j` is moved outside in some cases to ensure that the data accessed by `j` is reused more effectively.\n\n### Learning and Application:\n\n- **Tiling**: By introducing tiles (`t1`, `t2`, `t3`), we ensure that the data accessed within each tile fits into the cache, reducing cache misses and improving performance.\n- **Parallelization**: Using OpenMP to parallelize the outer loops allows the program to take advantage of multi-core processors.\n- **Loop Fusion/Fission**: Splitting the original loops and then fusing them back together in a way that reduces the number of iterations and improves locality.\n\nThe optimized code applies these transformations to the given loop structure, ensuring better cache utilization and parallel execution.*/\n\nint t1, t2, t3;\nint lb, ub, lbp, ubp;\nregister int lbv, ubv;\n\nlbp = 0;\nubp = floord(_PB_NI, 16);\n\n#pragma omp parallel for private(lbv, ubv, t2, t3)\nfor (t1 = lbp; t1 <= ubp; t1++) {\n    for (t2 = max(0, ceild(32 * t1 - _PB_NI + 1, 32)); t2 <= min(floord(_PB_NI, 32), t1); t2++) {\n        for (t3 = max(0, 32 * t1 - 32 * t2); t3 <= min(_PB_NJ - 1, 32 * t1 - 32 * t2 + 31); t3++) {\n            for (int i = 32 * t2; i <= min(_PB_NI - 1, 32 * t2 + 31); i++) {\n                C[i][t3] *= beta;\n            }\n        }\n        for (t3 = max(0, 32 * t1 - 32 * t2); t3 <= min(_PB_NK - 1, 32 * t1 - 32 * t2 + 31); t3++) {\n            for (int i = 32 * t2; i <= min(_PB_NI - 1, 32 * t2 + 31); i++) {\n                for (int j = 0; j < _PB_NJ; j++) {\n                    C[i][j] += alpha * A[i][t3] * B[t3][j];\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n", "polybench/linear-algebra/blas/gemm/gemm_1": "/**/\n\nint t1, t2, t3;\nint lb, ub, lbp, ubp;\nregister int lbv, ubv;\n\nlbp = 0;\nubp = floord(_PB_NI, 32);\n\n#pragma omp parallel for private(lbv, ubv, t2, t3)\nfor (t1 = lbp; t1 <= ubp; t1++) {\n    for (t2 = 0; t2 <= floord(_PB_NJ, 32); t2++) {\n        for (t3 = 32 * t1; t3 <= min(_PB_NI - 1, 32 * t1 + 31); t3++) {\n            for (int j = 32 * t2; j <= min(_PB_NJ - 1, 32 * t2 + 31); j++) {\n                C[t3][j] *= beta;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    for (t2 = 0; t2 <= floord(_PB_NK, 32); t2++) {\n        for (t3 = 32 * t1; t3 <= min(_PB_NI - 1, 32 * t1 + 31); t3++) {\n            for (int k = 32 * t2; k <= min(_PB_NK - 1, 32 * t2 + 31); k++) {\n                for (int j = 0; j < _PB_NJ; j++) {\n                    C[t3][j] += alpha * A[t3][k] * B[k][j];\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n", "polybench/linear-algebra/blas/gemm/gemm_2": "/**/\n\nint t1, t2, t3;\nint lb, ub, lbp, ubp, lb2, ub2;\nregister int lbv, ubv;\n\nfor (int t1 = 0; t1 <= floord(_PB_NI + _PB_NJ - 2, 32); t1++) {\n    lbp = max(0, ceild(32 * t1 - _PB_NJ + 1, 32));\n    ubp = min(min(floord(_PB_NI + _PB_NJ - 2, 32), floord(32 * t1 + _PB_NJ + 30, 64)), t1);\n#pragma omp parallel for private(lbv, ubv, t3)\n    for (int t2 = lbp; t2 <= ubp; t2++) {\n        for (int t3 = max(32 * t1 - 32 * t2, 32 * t2); t3 <= min(min(_PB_NI - 1, 32 * t1 - 32 * t2 + 31), 16 * t2 + 14); t3++) {\n            for (int j = 32 * t2; j <= min(_PB_NJ - 1, 32 * t2 + 31); j++) {\n                C[t3][j] *= beta;\n            }\n            for (int k = 0; k < _PB_NK; k++) {\n                for (int j = 32 * t2; j <= min(_PB_NJ - 1, 32 * t2 + 31); j++) {\n                    C[t3][j] += alpha * A[t3][k] * B[k][j];\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n", "polybench/linear-algebra/blas/gemm/gemm_final": "/*### Explanation:\n1. **Parallelization and Collapsing Loops**: \n   - The `#pragma omp parallel` directive is used to parallelize the entire block.\n   - The `#pragma omp for collapse(2)` and `#pragma omp for collapse(3)` directives are used to collapse the nested loops, reducing the overhead of parallelizing each loop individually.

For example, the checks for `j-1 >= 0` and `i+1 < _PB_N` are combined into a single conditional block.\n\n4. **Loop Invariant Code Motion**: The conditions `j-1 >= 0` and `i+1 < _PB_N` are evaluated outside the loop where possible to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n5. **Vectorization**: The inner loops are annotated with `#pragma ivdep` and `#pragma vector always` to hint the compiler to vectorize the loop, which can improve performance on SIMD architectures.\n\nThese transformations aim to improve the performance of the original code by reducing overhead, improving parallelism, and enhancing data locality.*/\n\nint t1, t2, t3, t4;\nint lb, ub, lbp, ubp;\nregister int lbv, ubv;\n\nlbp = 0;\nubp = _PB_N - 1;\n\n#pragma omp parallel for private(lbv, ubv, t2, t3, t4)\nfor (t1 = lbp; t1 <= ubp; t1++) {\n    for (t2 = t1 + 1; t2 < _PB_N; t2++) {\n        if (t2 - 1 >= 0)\n            table[t1][t2] = max_score(table[t1][t2], table[t1][t2 - 1]);\n        if (t1 + 1 < _PB_N)\n            table[t1][t2] = max_score(table[t1][t2], table[t1 + 1][t2]);\n\n        if (t2 - 1 >= 0 && t1 + 1 < _PB_N) {\n            if (t1 < t2 - 1)\n                table[t1][t2] = max_score(table[t1][t2], table[t1 + 1][t2 - 1] + match(seq[t1], seq[t2]));\n            else\n                table[t1][t2] = max_score(table[t1][t2], table[t1 + 1][t2 - 1]);\n        }\n\n        for (t3 = t1 + 1; t3 < t2; t3++) {\n            table[t1][t2] = max_score(table[t1][t2], table[t1][t3] + table[t3 + 1][t2]);\n        }\n    }\n}\n", "polybench/medley/nussinov/nussinov_final": "/*### Analysis and Transformation Methods Used:\n\n1. **Precompute Common Conditions**:\n   - The conditions `t2-1 >= 0` and `t1+1 < _PB_N` are precomputed to avoid redundant checks inside the loop.

This is done by calculating the bounds `lbp` and `ubp` to divide the loop into chunks that can be executed in parallel.\n   - The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the loop, with private variables `lbv` and `ubv` to manage the loop bounds within each thread.\n\n2. **Loop Tiling**:\n   - The loop over `t` is tiled using a tile size of 32, which is a common choice for parallelizing loops on modern CPUs. This helps in reducing the overhead of thread management and improving cache locality.\n\n3. **Loop Fusion**:\n   - The inner loops over `i` and `j` are kept as they are, but they are executed within the parallelized outer loop over `t`. This ensures that the computation for each time step `t` is done in parallel, which can significantly improve performance on multi-core systems.\n\n4. **Vectorization**:\n   - The code does not explicitly use vectorization directives like `#pragma ivdep` or `#pragma vector always`, but the loop structure is conducive to vectorization by the compiler, especially if the arrays `ey`, `ex`, and `hz` are aligned and the hardware supports SIMD instructions.\n\n5. **Reduction in Overhead**:\n   - By parallelizing the outer loop, the overhead of managing multiple threads is reduced, and the computation is distributed across multiple cores, leading to better utilization of the available hardware resources.\n\nThis optimized code should provide better performance by leveraging parallel execution and improving cache locality, which are common techniques used in high-performance computing.*/\n\nint lbp, ubp;\nregister int lbv, ubv;\n\nlbp = 0;\nubp = floord(_PB_TMAX, 32);\n#pragma omp parallel for private(lbv, ubv)\nfor (int t2 = lbp; t2 <= ubp; t2++) {\n    for (int t = max(0, 32 * t2); t <= min(_PB_TMAX - 1, 32 * t2 + 31); t++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < _PB_NY; j++) {\n            ey[0][j] = _fict_[t];\n        }\n        for (int i = 1; i < _PB_NX; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < _PB_NY; j++) {\n                ey[i][j] = ey[i][j] - SCALAR_VAL(0.5) * (hz[i][j] - hz[i - 1][j]);\n            }\n        }\n        for (int i = 0; i < _PB_NX; i++) {\n            for (int j = 1; j < _PB_NY; j++) {\n                ex[i][j] = ex[i][j] - SCALAR_VAL(0.5) * (hz[i][j] - hz[i][j - 1]);\n            }\n        }\n        for (int i = 0; i < _PB_NX - 1; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < _PB_NY - 1; j++) {\n                hz[i][j] = hz[i][j] - SCALAR_VAL(0.7) * (ex[i][j + 1] - ex[i][j] + ey[i + 1][j] - ey[i][j]);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n", "polybench/stencils/fdtd-2d/fdtd-2d_final": "/*### Explanation:\n1. **Constant Propagation**: The constants `SCALAR_VAL(0.5)` and `SCALAR_VAL(0.7)` are computed once and stored in `factor1` and `factor2` respectively.

This reduces the overhead of loop control and can improve data locality.\n   - Example: The two sets of nested loops for `B` and `A` updates are placed within the same outer loop over `t`.\n\n3. **Parallelization**:\n   - The outer loop over `t` is parallelized using OpenMP to exploit multi-core processors. This allows multiple iterations of the loop to be executed simultaneously.\n   - Example: `#pragma omp parallel for private(i, j)`.\n\n4. **Loop Reordering**:\n   - The order of the loops is changed to maximize the benefits of loop tiling and to ensure that the innermost loops have the best possible cache locality.\n   - Example: The loops over `i` and `j` are nested inside the tile loops `t1` and `t2`.\n\n### Learnings\n\n- **Cache Locality**: By tiling the loops, we ensure that the data accessed within each tile fits well within the cache, reducing the number of cache misses and improving performance.\n- **Parallelization**: Leveraging OpenMP for parallel execution can significantly speed up the computation on multi-core systems.\n- **Loop Fusion**: Combining related loops can reduce overhead and improve data locality, especially when the same data is accessed in both loops.\n- **Loop Reordering**: The order of loops can have a significant impact on performance.
