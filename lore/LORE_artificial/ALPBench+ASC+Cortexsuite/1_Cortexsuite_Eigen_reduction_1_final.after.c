/*### Explanation of the Further Optimized Version:
1. **Loop Fusion**: The two inner loops over `j` and `k` are fused into a single loop, as in the previous optimized versions.
2. **Intermediate Variable**: The intermediate variable `sum` is used to accumulate the result of the inner loop over `k2`, as in the previous optimized versions.
3. **Array Localization**: The `interm` array is declared inside the outer loop to limit its scope and potentially improve memory locality, as in the previous optimized versions.
4. **Loop Order**: The loop order is maintained to ensure that the operations are performed in a way that maximizes the reuse of data in the cache, as in the previous optimized versions.
5. **Loop Unrolling**: The innermost loop is partially unrolled by a factor of 4 to reduce the overhead of loop control and improve instruction-level parallelism. This is a new optimization that can further enhance performance by reducing the number of iterations and improving the efficiency of the CPU's instruction pipeline.*/

/*### Explanation of Optimizations:
1. **Loop Fusion**: The two inner loops over `j` and `k` are fused into a single loop. This reduces the overhead of loop control and potentially improves cache locality.
2. **Intermediate Variable**: The intermediate variable `sum` is used to accumulate the result of the inner loop over `k2`. This avoids multiple writes to `data[i][k]` and reduces the number of memory accesses.
3. **Array Localization**: The `interm` array is declared inside the outer loop to limit its scope and potentially improve memory locality. This ensures that `interm` is reused for each iteration of the outer loop.
4. **Loop Order**: The loop order is maintained to ensure that the operations are performed in a way that maximizes the reuse of data in the cache. The outer loop iterates over `i`, the middle loop over `k`, and the innermost loop over `k2`.
5. **Loop Unrolling**: The innermost loop is partially unrolled to reduce the overhead of loop control and improve instruction-level parallelism.

These optimizations are based on the principles of loop fusion, intermediate variable usage, array localization, and loop unrolling, which are common techniques to improve the performance of nested loops.*/
