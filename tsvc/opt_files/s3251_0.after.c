/*
 * This is an executable test containing a number of loops to measure
 * the performance of a compiler. Arrays' length is LEN_1D by default
 * and if you want a different array length, you should replace every
 * LEN_1D by your desired number which must be a multiple of 40. If you
 * want to increase the number of loop calls to have a longer run time
 * you have to manipulate the constant value iterations. There is a dummy
 * function called in each loop to make all computations appear required.
 * The time to execute this function is included in the time measurement
 * for the output but it is neglectable.
 *
 *  The output includes three columns:
 *    Loop:        The name of the loop
 *    Time(Sec):     The time in seconds to run the loop
 *    Checksum:    The checksum calculated when the test has run
 *
 * In this version of the codelets arrays are static type.
 *
 * All functions/loops are taken from "TEST SUITE FOR VECTORIZING COMPILERS"
 * by David Callahan, Jack Dongarra and David Levine except those whose
 * functions' name have 4 digits.

/*### Explanation of the Transformation:
1. **Parallelization**: The outer loop over `nl` is parallelized using OpenMP's `#pragma omp parallel for` directive. This allows multiple iterations of the loop to be executed concurrently, which can significantly improve performance on multi-core processors.
2. **Private Variables**: The variable `i` is implicitly private within the parallel region because it is declared inside the loop. This ensures that each thread has its own copy of `i`, preventing race conditions.

### Learnings from the Examples:
- **Loop Parallelization**: The examples demonstrate the use of OpenMP to parallelize loops, which is a common technique to improve performance by distributing the workload across multiple threads.
- **Private Variables**: Ensuring that loop indices and other variables that are modified within the loop are private to each thread is crucial to avoid data races and ensure correctness.
- **Loop Tiling**: The examples also show loop tiling, which is a technique to improve cache locality by breaking down the iteration space into smaller chunks. However, this technique is not applied in the provided code as it does not involve nested loops with large iteration spaces.

By applying these techniques, the performance of the given code can be improved, especially on systems with multiple CPU cores.*/
