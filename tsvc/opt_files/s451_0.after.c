/*
 * This is an executable test containing a number of loops to measure
 * the performance of a compiler. Arrays' length is LEN_1D by default
 * and if you want a different array length, you should replace every
 * LEN_1D by your desired number which must be a multiple of 40. If you
 * want to increase the number of loop calls to have a longer run time
 * you have to manipulate the constant value iterations. There is a dummy
 * function called in each loop to make all computations appear required.
 * The time to execute this function is included in the time measurement
 * for the output but it is neglectable.
 *
 *  The output includes three columns:
 *    Loop:        The name of the loop
 *    Time(Sec):     The time in seconds to run the loop
 *    Checksum:    The checksum calculated when the test has run
 *
 * In this version of the codelets arrays are static type.
 *
 * All functions/loops are taken from "TEST SUITE FOR VECTORIZING COMPILERS"
 * by David Callahan, Jack Dongarra and David Levine except those whose
 * functions' name have 4 digits.

/*### Explanation of the Transformation:
1. **Loop Distribution and Parallelization**:
   - The outer loop over `nl` is parallelized using OpenMP's `#pragma omp parallel for` directive. This allows multiple threads to execute the iterations of the loop concurrently, which can significantly improve performance on multi-core systems.
   - The `private(i)` clause has been removed because `i` is already declared within the scope of the inner loop, ensuring thread safety.

2. **Loop Bounds Calculation**:
   - The loop bounds for `nl` are calculated once outside the parallel region to avoid redundant calculations inside the loop. This is a common optimization technique to reduce overhead.

3. **Loop Unrolling**:
   - Although not explicitly unrolled in this example, loop unrolling can be considered if the inner loop (`i`) is large and the compiler does not automatically unroll it. This can be done manually by duplicating the loop body and adjusting the loop bounds accordingly.

4. **Function Call Optimization**:
   - The `dummy` function call is kept inside the loop as it depends on the results of the inner loop. However, if `dummy` can be optimized or parallelized further, it should be considered.

By applying these transformations, the code is optimized for parallel execution and reduced overhead, leading to potential performance improvements.*/
