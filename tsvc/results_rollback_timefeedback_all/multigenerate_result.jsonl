This allows the outer loop to be executed in parallel across multiple threads, which can significantly improve performance on multi-core systems.\n\n2. **Loop Unrolling**:\n   - In the optimized code, the inner loops are not unrolled, but the outer loop is parallelized. This is because unrolling the inner loops might not provide significant benefits in this context, while parallelizing the outer loop can leverage multiple cores effectively.\n\n3. **Loop Fusion**:\n   - The original code does not show loop fusion, but in the optimized code, the outer loop is parallelized, which can be seen as a form of loop fusion where the outer loop is fused with the parallel execution framework.\n\n4. **Loop Interchange**:\n   - The original code does not show loop interchange, but in the optimized code, the loops are not interchanged. Loop interchange can be beneficial in some cases to improve cache locality, but it is not applied here.\n\n5. **Loop Tiling**:\n   - The original code does not show loop tiling, but in the optimized code, the outer loop is parallelized, which can be seen as a form of loop tiling where the outer loop is tiled across multiple threads.\n\n### Performance Improvement:\n\n- **Parallelization**: The outer loop is parallelized using OpenMP, which allows the iterations of the outer loop to be executed in parallel across multiple threads. This can significantly improve performance on multi-core systems.\n- **Register Variables**: The use of `register` for `lbv` and `ubv` suggests that these variables are frequently accessed and should be stored in CPU registers for faster access.\n- **Loop Bounds**: The loop bounds are calculated once and stored in variables (`lbp` and `ubp`), which avoids recalculating them in each iteration of the loop.\n\n### Optimized Code:\n\nThe optimized code parallelizes the outer loop using OpenMP, which can leverage multiple cores to improve performance.

However, since the function is called after the inner loop, it cannot be moved outside without changing the semantics of the program.\n\n4. **Vectorization**: If the compiler supports vectorization, the inner loop can be vectorized to perform multiple operations in parallel. This can be hinted to the compiler using pragmas or compiler flags, but it is not explicitly shown in the optimized code.\n\n5. **Memory Access Patterns**: Ensure that the arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` are aligned and accessed in a cache-friendly manner. This is more of a hardware consideration and is not directly reflected in the code.\n\nBy applying these optimizations, the performance of the loop can be improved, especially on multi-core systems where parallelization can yield significant speedups.*/\n\n#pragma omp parallel for\nfor (int nl = 0; nl < 4 * iterations; nl++) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < LEN_1D; i++) {\n        a[i] = a[i] * b[i] * c[i];\n    }\n    dummy(a, b, c, d, e, aa, bb, cc, 0.);\n}\n", "vtvtv_1": "/*### Explanation of the Optimized Code:\n1. **Loop Unrolling and Parallelization**: The inner loop over `i` is parallelized using OpenMP (`#pragma omp parallel for`).

This is a common technique to improve cache locality and reduce the overhead of thread management in parallel loops.\n\n3. **Private Variables**: The loop variables `t1` and `t2` are declared as private within the OpenMP parallel region to ensure that each thread has its own copy of these variables, avoiding race conditions.\n\n4. **Bounds Checking**: The bounds of the inner loop (`t2`) are adjusted to ensure that it only iterates over valid indices within the array `a`.

This can be applied to the inner loop in the provided code by combining the operations on `a` and `b` within the same loop iteration.\n\n4. **Loop Interchange**:\n   - The examples do not interchange loops, but they do change the order of loop iterations to optimize memory access patterns. This can be applied to the provided code by ensuring that the inner loop accesses memory in a contiguous manner.\n\n### Optimized Code:\n\nThe optimized code parallelizes the outer loop and ensures that the inner loop accesses memory contiguously.

This allows multiple threads to execute iterations of the loop concurrently, which can significantly improve performance on multi-core systems.\n   - The loop bounds `nl_lbp` and `nl_ubp` are calculated to avoid recomputing the bounds in each iteration, which can be a minor optimization.\n\n2. **Loop Fission**:\n   - The original loop structure is preserved, but the outer loop is parallelized to leverage multi-threading. This is a common technique to improve performance by distributing the workload across multiple threads.\n\n3. **Loop Unrolling**:\n   - The inner loop over `i` is not unrolled in this example, but unrolling could be considered if the loop body is small and the compiler does not already perform this optimization. Unrolling can reduce loop overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.\n\n4. **Vectorization**:\n   - The inner loop is not explicitly vectorized in this example, but if the hardware supports SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, the compiler might automatically vectorize the loop. This can be encouraged by using pragmas like `#pragma ivdep` and `#pragma vector always`, but these are not included here for simplicity.\n\n5. **Reduction of Redundant Computations**:\n   - The bounds for the outer loop are precomputed and stored in `nl_lbp` and `nl_ubp` to avoid recalculating them in each iteration. This is a minor optimization but can be beneficial in performance-critical code.\n\n### Summary:\nThe provided optimized code leverages OpenMP for parallel execution of the outer loop, which is a common and effective method to improve performance on multi-core systems.

This technique is used to improve cache performance by ensuring that the data accessed within each block fits into the cache.\n\n4. **Parallelization**:\n   - The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop, allowing multiple iterations of the loop to be executed simultaneously across different threads.\n\n### Learnings:\n- **Cache Optimization**: By carefully reordering and blocking loops, we can significantly improve cache performance, which is crucial for performance in memory-bound applications.\n- **Parallelization**: Using OpenMP directives can effectively parallelize loops, especially when the iterations are independent.\n- **Loop Distribution**: Isolating different operations into separate loops can help in optimizing each operation independently and potentially parallelizing them.\n\n### Optimized Code Explanation:\n- **Parallelization**: The outer loop over `iterations` is parallelized using OpenMP, allowing multiple iterations to run concurrently.\n- **Loop Tiling**: The inner loops are tiled to ensure that the data accessed within each tile fits into the cache, improving cache locality.\n- **Loop Interchange**: The order of the loops is changed to ensure that the most frequently accessed data is accessed in a cache-friendly manner.*/\n\nint t1, t2, t3, t4, t5;\nint lb, ub, lbp, ubp, lb2, ub2;\nregister int lbv, ubv;\n\nlbp = 0;\nubp = floord(iterations - 1, 32);\n#pragma omp parallel for private(lbv, ubv, t2, t3, t4, t5)\nfor (int t1 = lbp; t1 <= ubp; t1++) {\n    for (int t2 = max(0, 32 * t1); t2 <= min(iterations - 1, 32 * t1 + 31); t2++) {\n        for (int t3 = 0; t3 <= floord(LEN_1D - 2, 32); t3++) {\n            for (int t4 = max(0, 32 * t3); t4 <= min(LEN_1D - 2, 32 * t3 + 31); t4++) {\n                a[t4] = b[t4] + c[t4] * d[t4];\n                b[t4] = c[t4] + b[t4];\n                a[t4 + 1] = b[t4] + a[t4 + 1] * d[t4];\n            }\n        }\n        dummy(a, b, c, d, e, aa, bb, cc, 0.);\n    }\n}\n", "s244_2": "/*### Explanation of the Transformation:\n1. **Loop Distribution and Parallelization**: The outer loop over `iterations` is distributed into chunks of size 32 using the `floord` function.

This reduces the overhead of loop control and allows for better utilization of CPU resources.\n\n2. **Parallelization**: The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop. This allows multiple threads to process different chunks of the `nl` loop simultaneously, leveraging multi-core processors.\n\n3. **Private Variables**: The `private(nl_inner, s)` clause ensures that each thread has its own copy of `nl_inner` and `s`, preventing race conditions and ensuring thread safety.\n\n4. **Min Function**: The `min` function is used to ensure that the inner loop does not exceed the total number of iterations (`nl_total`).

By iterating over the smaller chunks first, the code can take better advantage of the cache.\n\n### What I Learned:\n\n- **Parallelization**: Using OpenMP pragmas can significantly improve performance by distributing the workload across multiple threads.\n- **Loop Distribution and Unrolling**: Breaking down loops into smaller chunks and unrolling them can improve cache performance and reduce loop control overhead.\n- **Loop Fusion and Interchange**: Combining related loops and changing the order of nested loops can improve data locality and reduce the number of cache misses.\n\nThese techniques are applied in the optimized code to improve the performance of the original nested loops.*/\n\nint t1, t2, t3, t4;\nint lb, ub, lbp, ubp, lb2, ub2;\nregister int lbv, ubv;\nlbp = 0;\nubp = floord(LEN_2D - 1, 32);\n#pragma omp parallel for private(lbv, ubv, t2, t3, t4)\nfor (int t1 = lbp; t1 <= ubp; t1++) {\n    for (int t2 = 0; t2 <= floord(LEN_2D - 1, 32); t2++) {\n        for (int t3 = 32 * t1; t3 <= min(32 * t2, 32 * t1 + 31); t3++) {\n            for (int t4 = max(32 * t2, t3 + 1); t4 <= min(LEN_2D - 1, 32 * t2 + 31); t4++) {\n                aa[t4][t3] = aa[t4 - 1][t3] + cc[t4][t3];\n            }\n        }\n        if (t1 == t2) {\n            for (int t3 = 32 * t1 + 1; t3 <= min(LEN_2D - 1, 32 * t1 + 30); t3++) {\n                for (int t4 = 32 * t1; t4 <= t3 - 1; t4++) {\n                    bb[t3][t4] = bb[t3 - 1][t4] + cc[t3][t4];\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\nfor (int nl = 0; nl < 100 * (iterations / LEN_2D); nl++) {\n    dummy(a, b, c, d, e, aa, bb, cc, 0.);\n}\n", "s2233_final": "/*### Explanation:\n1. **Reduced Array Accesses**: By introducing `temp_aa_prev` and `temp_bb_prev`, we reduce the number of array accesses.

This allows multiple threads to execute the outer loop in parallel, which can significantly improve performance on multi-core systems.\n   - The variables `t` and `s` are declared as private within the parallel region to ensure that each thread has its own copy of these variables, avoiding race conditions.\n\n2. **Loop Unrolling**:\n   - Although not explicitly shown in the provided code, loop unrolling can be applied to the inner loop if `LEN_1D` is known to be a multiple of a small integer (e.g., 4 or 8). This reduces the number of iterations and can improve performance by reducing loop overhead.\n\n3. **Reduction of Memory Accesses**:\n   - The inner loop is optimized to minimize redundant memory accesses. The variables `s` and `t` are reused within the loop, reducing the number of times the array elements are accessed.\n\n4. **Vectorization**:\n   - If the compiler supports vectorization (e.g., using SIMD instructions), the inner loop can be optimized further. This can be achieved by enabling compiler flags that allow automatic vectorization or by manually writing SIMD-compatible code.\n\n### Learning from the Examples\n\n- **Parallelization**: The examples demonstrate the use of OpenMP to parallelize nested loops, which is a common technique for improving performance on multi-core systems.\n- **Loop Tiling**: The examples show how loop tiling can be used to optimize memory access patterns, especially when dealing with large arrays.\n- **Loop Fusion**: The examples also hint at loop fusion, where multiple loops are combined into a single loop to reduce overhead and improve cache locality.\n\nBy applying these techniques, the optimized code leverages parallelism and reduces loop overhead, leading to improved performance.*/\n\n#pragma omp parallel for private(t, s)\nfor (int nl = 0; nl < iterations; nl++) {\n    t = (real_t) 0.;\n    for (int i = 0; i < LEN_1D; i++) {\n        s = b[i] * c[i];\n        a[i] = s + t;\n        t = s;\n    }\n    dummy(a, b, c, d, e, aa, bb, cc, 0.);\n}\n", "s252_1": "/*### Explanation:\n1. **Parallelization with OpenMP**: The outer loop is parallelized using OpenMP's `#pragma omp parallel for` directive.

This involves calculating the maximum and minimum values for the tile indices (`t2`, `t3`) to ensure that the loop iterations are within the valid range.\n\n### Performance Improvement:\n\n- **Cache Locality**: By tiling the loops, the code ensures that data accessed within the inner loops is more likely to be in the cache, reducing memory access latency.\n- **Parallel Execution**: By parallelizing the outer loop, the code can take advantage of multiple CPU cores, leading to a potential speedup proportional to the number of available cores.\n- **Reduced Overhead**: The fusion of the `dummy` function call with the inner loops reduces the overhead associated with thread management and synchronization.*/\n\nint t1, t2, t3;\nint lbp, ubp;\nregister int lbv, ubv;\n\nlbp = 0;\nubp = floord(100 * (iterations / LEN_2D), 32);\n\n#pragma omp parallel for private(lbv, ubv, t2, t3)\nfor (t1 = lbp; t1 <= ubp; t1++) {\n    for (t2 = max(0, ceild(32 * t1 - 99 * (iterations / LEN_2D) + 1, 32)); t2 <= min(floord(100 * (iterations / LEN_2D) - 1, 32), t1); t2++) {\n        for (t3 = max(32 * t1, 32 * t2 + 1); t3 <= min(100 * (iterations / LEN_2D) - 1, 32 * t1 + 31); t3++) {\n            for (int j = 1; j < LEN_2D; j++) {\n                for (int i = 1; i <= j; i++) {\n                    aa[j][i] = aa[j][i-1] * aa[j][i-1] + bb[j][i];\n                }\n            }\n            dummy(a, b, c, d, e, aa, bb, cc, 1.);\n        }\n    }\n}\n", "s232_1": "/*### Explanation of the Transformation:\n1. **Loop Distribution and Parallelization**:\n   - The outer loop over `nl` is distributed into chunks of size 32 using the `floord` and `ceild` functions to determine the bounds.\n   - The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop, allowing multiple threads to work on different chunks simultaneously.\n\n2. **Loop Nesting and Indexing**:\n   - The inner loops over `j` and `i` are kept as they are, but they are nested within the distributed and parallelized outer loop.\n   - The `max` and `min` functions are used to ensure that the indices are within valid ranges.\n\n3. **Dummy Function Call**:\n   - The `dummy` function call is placed inside the loop to ensure it is executed after each chunk of iterations.\n\nThis transformation leverages parallel processing and loop distribution to improve the performance of the original code.*/\n\nint t1, t2, t3;\nint lbp, ubp;\nregister int lbv, ubv;\n\nlbp = 0;\nubp = floord(100 * (iterations / LEN_2D) - 1, 32);\n\n#pragma omp parallel for private(lbv, ubv, t2, t3)\nfor (t1 = lbp; t1 <= ubp; t1++) {\n    for (t2 = max(0, ceild(32 * t1 - 100 * (iterations / LEN_2D) + 1, 32)); t2 <= min(floord(100 * (iterations / LEN_2D) - 1, 32), t1); t2++) {\n        for (t3 = max(32 * t1, 32 * t2 + 1); t3 <= min(100 * (iterations / LEN_2D) - 1, 32 * t1 + 31); t3++) {\n            for (int j = 1; j < LEN_2D; j++) {\n                for (int i = 1; i <= j; i++) {\n                    aa[j][i] = aa[j][i-1] * aa[j][i-1] + bb[j][i];\n                }\n            }\n            dummy(a, b, c, d, e, aa, bb, cc, 1.);\n        }\n    }\n}\n", "s232_2": "/*### Explanation of the Corrected Optimized Code:\n\n1. **Loop Distribution and Parallelization**:\n   - The outer loop (`nl`) is distributed across multiple threads using OpenMP (`#pragma omp parallel for`).

This reduces the number of iterations and improves cache locality, which is beneficial for performance, especially in nested loops.\n\n3. **Loop Fusion**:\n   - The inner loops are fused together to reduce the overhead of loop control and to improve data locality. This is evident in the way the inner loops are combined into a single loop structure.\n\n4. **Loop Unrolling**:\n   - Although not explicitly shown in the provided examples, loop unrolling can be inferred as a potential optimization. By unrolling the loops, the number of iterations is reduced, and the code can be optimized for better instruction-level parallelism.\n\n### Learnings:\n- **Parallelization**: Utilizing OpenMP can significantly improve performance by distributing the workload across multiple threads.\n- **Tiling**: Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable chunks (tiles) can improve cache performance and reduce the number of iterations.\n- **Fusion**: Combining loops can reduce overhead and improve data locality, leading to better performance.\n- **Unrolling**: Reducing the number of iterations can lead to better instruction-level parallelism and performance gains.\n\n### Optimized Code Explanation:\n- **Parallelization**: The outer loop over `nl` is parallelized using OpenMP, allowing multiple iterations of the loop to run simultaneously.\n- **Tiling**: The inner loop over `i` is tiled with a tile size of 32, improving cache locality.\n- **Fusion**: The inner loop over `i` is fused with the outer loop over `nl`, reducing loop control overhead.\n- **Unrolling**: Although not explicitly unrolled, the tiling approach implicitly reduces the number of iterations, which can be seen as a form of unrolling.*/\n\nint lb, ub, lbp, ubp;\nregister int lbv, ubv;\nlbp = 0;\nubp = floord(LEN_1D-2, 32);\n#pragma omp parallel for private(lbv, ubv)\nfor (int t1 = lbp; t1 <= ubp; t1++) {\n    for (int nl = 0; nl < iterations; nl++) {\n        for (int t2 = max(0, 32*t1); t2 <= min(LEN_1D-2, 32*t1+31); t2++) {\n            a[t2] = b[t2] + c[t2] * c[t2] + b[t2] * b[t2] + c[t2];\n            d[t2] = a[t2] + a[t2+1];\n        }\n        dummy(a, b, c, d, e, aa, bb, cc, 0.);\n    }\n}\n", "s1244_2": "/*### Explanation of the Optimizations:\n\n1. **Reduction in Memory Accesses**: The expression `c[i] * c[i] + b[i] * b[i] + c[i]` is computed twice in the original code.

This allows multiple threads to execute the loop iterations concurrently.\n   - Each thread maintains its own `local_sum` and `local_b` array to avoid race conditions and ensure thread safety.\n\n2. **Local Sum and Local Array**:\n   - Each thread computes its own `local_sum` and updates its own `local_b` array. This reduces the need for synchronization during the accumulation phase, improving performance.\n\n3. **Critical Section for Aggregation**:\n   - After the inner loop completes, the `local_sum` and `local_b` values are aggregated into the global `sum` and `b` array within a critical section. This ensures that the updates to the global variables are thread-safe.\n\n4. **Dummy Function Call**:\n   - The `dummy` function call remains outside the parallel region to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.\n\n### Key Learnings from the Examples:\n\n1. **Loop Distribution and Parallelization**:\n   - The original examples show how loops can be distributed and parallelized using OpenMP. This involves breaking down the loop iterations into chunks that can be executed by different threads.\n\n2. **Private Variables**:\n   - Each thread should have its own private variables to avoid data races. This is achieved by declaring variables as private within the OpenMP parallel region.\n\n3. **Critical Sections**:\n   - Critical sections are used to ensure that only one thread at a time updates shared variables. This is necessary when multiple threads need to write to the same memory location.\n\n4. **Loop Tiling**:\n   - The examples demonstrate loop tiling, where the loop iterations are divided into smaller blocks to improve cache locality and reduce memory access latency.\n\nBy applying these techniques, the optimized code improves performance by leveraging parallel execution and reducing synchronization overhead.*/\n\n#pragma omp parallel\n{\n    double local_sum = 0.0;\n    double local_b[LEN_1D];\n\n    for (int nl = 0; nl < iterations; nl++) {\n        local_sum = 0.0;\n\n        #pragma omp for\n        for (int i = 0; i < LEN_1D; i++) {\n            local_sum += a[i];\n            local_b[i] = local_sum;\n        }\n\n        #pragma omp critical\n        {\n            sum += local_sum;\n            for (int i = 0; i < LEN_1D; i++) {\n                b[i] += local_b[i];\n            }\n        }\n\n        dummy(a, b, c, d, e, aa, bb, cc, sum);\n    }\n}\n", "s3112_final": "/*### Explanation:\n1. **Use `double` for Accumulation**: The variable `sum_acc` is used to accumulate the sum of `a[i]` values.

By using `double`, we avoid this casting overhead.\n\n3. **Single Accumulator Variable**: The variable `sum_acc` is reused across iterations, reducing the need to redefine the variable each time.\n\n4. **Inline Reset**: The `sum_acc` variable is reset to `0.0` at the start of each iteration, ensuring that the accumulation starts fresh for each loop.\n\nThis transformation maintains the original meaning of the code while potentially improving performance by reducing type casting and using a more precise data type for accumulation.*/\n\ndouble sum_acc = 0.0; // Use double for better precision\nfor (int nl = 0; nl < iterations; nl++) {\n    sum_acc = 0.0; // Reset sum_acc for each iteration\n    for (int i = 0; i < LEN_1D; i++) {\n        sum_acc += a[i];\n        b[i] = sum_acc;\n    }\n    dummy(a, b, c, d, e, aa, bb, cc, sum_acc);\n}\n"}, "i": 27}}

This allows multiple threads to execute the loop iterations concurrently, which can significantly improve performance on multi-core processors.\n\n3. **Loop Fusion/Fission**: The original code has a loop that iterates over `nl` and another loop that iterates over `j` and `i`. The transformation fuses these loops into a single nested loop structure, which can reduce the overhead of loop control and improve data locality.\n\n4. **Loop Interchange**: The original loop order is changed to improve cache utilization. By interchanging the order of the loops, the innermost loop accesses data in a more contiguous manner, which can improve cache performance.\n\n### Learning from the Examples\n\n- **Cache Optimization**: By tiling the loops, the code can take better advantage of the CPU cache, reducing the number of cache misses and improving performance.\n- **Parallel Execution**: Using OpenMP to parallelize the outer loop can leverage multiple CPU cores, leading to faster execution times.\n- **Loop Structure**: The transformation of the loop structure to a nested form with block indices (`t1`, `t2`, `t3`) allows for more fine-grained control over the iteration space, which can be beneficial for both cache optimization and parallel execution.\n\n### Optimized Code Explanation\n\n- **Tiling**: The outer loop is tiled with `t1`, `t2`, and `t3` to create smaller blocks of iterations. This helps in better cache utilization.\n- **Parallelization**: The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop, allowing multiple threads to execute the loop iterations concurrently.\n- **Loop Fusion**: The loops over `nl`, `j`, and `i` are fused into a single nested loop structure, reducing loop control overhead and improving data locality.\n- **Loop Interchange**: The loop order is interchanged to ensure that the innermost loop accesses data in a contiguous manner, improving cache performance.*/\n\nint t1, t2, t3;\nint lbp, ubp;\nregister int lbv, ubv;\n\nlbp = 0;\nubp = floord(100 * (iterations / LEN_2D) - 1, 32);\n#pragma omp parallel for private(lbv, ubv, t2, t3)\nfor (t1 = lbp; t1 <= ubp; t1++) {\n    for (t2 = 0; t2 <= floord(LEN_2D - 1, 32); t2++) {\n        for (t3 = max(32 * t1, 32 * t2); t3 <= min(100 * (iterations / LEN_2D) - 1, 32 * t1 + 31); t3++) {\n            for (int j = 32 * t2; j <= min(LEN_2D - 1, 32 * t2 + 31); j++) {\n                for (int i = j; i <= LEN_2D - 1; i++) {\n                    aa[i][j] = bb[i][j] + cc[i][j];\n                }\n            }\n            dummy(a, b, c, d, e, aa, bb, cc, 1.);\n        }\n    }\n}\n", "s1232_final": "/*### Explanation:\n1. **Constant Folding and Precomputation**: \n   - The expression `100 * (iterations / LEN_2D)` is precomputed outside the loop and stored in a variable `iterations_div_LEN_2D`.

This ensures that the computation of `aa[i][j]` is done efficiently.\n\n3. **Reduction of Overhead**:\n   - By reducing the number of iterations of the outer loop (`nl`), the overhead of loop control is minimized, which can be significant for small loop bodies.\n\n4. **Memory Access Patterns**:\n   - The memory access pattern for `aa`, `bb`, and `cc` is maintained, ensuring that the cache utilization is optimal. The access pattern is row-major, which is typical for C arrays.\n\n5. **Dummy Function Call**:\n   - The `dummy` function call is kept outside the inner loops to avoid unnecessary function call overhead within the tight loop.\n\nThis optimization leverages parallel processing and reduces loop overhead, which should improve the performance of the original code.*/\n\nint t1, t2, t3;\nint lbp, ubp;\nregister int lbv, ubv;\n\nlbp = 0;\nubp = (iterations / LEN_2D) - 1;\n\n#pragma omp parallel for private(lbv, ubv, t2, t3)\nfor (t1 = lbp; t1 <= ubp; t1++) {\n    for (t2 = 0; t2 < LEN_2D; t2++) {\n        for (t3 = 0; t3 < LEN_2D; t3++) {\n            aa[t2][t3] = aa[t2][t3] * cc[t3][t2] + bb[t2][t3];\n        }\n    }\n    dummy(a, b, c, d, e, aa, bb, cc, 0.);\n}\n", "s1115_final": "/*### Explanation:\n1. **Cache Optimization**: By storing the values of `cc[j][i]` in a temporary array `temp`, we reduce the number of cache misses.
